Vijeo Designer is a powerful and user-friendly software application that allows you to create and configure a control panel and Human Machine Interface (HMI) operating parameters for various Schneider Electric devices. It provides all the tools you need to design, simulate, test, and debug your HMI project.
 
However, to use Vijeo Designer on your PC, you need a valid license that matches the version of the software you have installed. If you have an older version of Vijeo Designer, such as 6.1 or 6.0, you can update your license to 6.2 by purchasing an update license from an authorized distributor.
