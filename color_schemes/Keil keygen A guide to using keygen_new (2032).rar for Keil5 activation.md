# Keil Software: A Comprehensive Guide for Embedded System Development
 
Keil software is a suite of development tools for embedded system applications. Keil software supports a wide range of microcontroller architectures, such as Arm, 8051, C166, C251, and XC16x/C16x/ST10. Keil software provides an integrated development environment (IDE), compilers, debuggers, simulators, and hardware tools to help you create, test, and optimize your embedded software.
 
## What is Keil Software?
 
Keil software is a product of Arm Limited, a global leader in semiconductor and software design. Keil software was founded in 1982 by GÃ¼nter and Reinhard Keil as a German company that developed software for the Intel MCS-51 microcontroller family. In 1985, Keil software introduced the first C compiler for the 8051 microcontroller. In 1995, Keil software became part of Philips Semiconductors (now NXP). In 2005, Keil software was acquired by Arm Limited and became part of its development tools portfolio.
