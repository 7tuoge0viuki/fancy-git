If you are a fan of Evil Dead and want to watch it in Tamil, you might be wondering how to do that without paying any money. Well, there are some ways to watch Evil Dead movie in Tamil for free online, but they come with some risks and drawbacks. Here are some of them:
 
- **YouTube**: You can find some dubbed versions of Evil Dead movies on YouTube, such as [Evil Dead | Tamil Dubbed Movie | Horror | Comedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk1fOsleLnM) [^1^]. However, these videos are often low-quality, incomplete, or have poor audio. They are also prone to being taken down by copyright holders or blocked in some countries.
- **Internet Archive**: You can also download some Evil Dead movies from the Internet Archive, such as [Evil Dead 2013](https://archive.org/details/evil-dead-2013_202107) [^2^]. However, these files are usually large and may take a long time to download. They may also not have subtitles or dubbing in Tamil. Moreover, downloading copyrighted movies may be illegal in your country.
- **TamilRockers**: TamilRockers is a notorious website that leaks pirated movies online, including Evil Dead movies in Tamil. For example, they reportedly leaked [Evil Dead Rise Full Movie in HD](https://www.latestly.com/entertainment/hollywood/evil-dead-rise-full-movie-in-hd-leaked-on-tamilrockers-alyssa-sutherland-lily-sullivans-horror-film-is-the-latest-victim-of-piracy-5073448.html) [^3^]. However, visiting this website is very risky, as it may expose you to malware, viruses, phishing, or legal action.

Now that you know how to watch Evil Dead movie in Tamil for free online, you might be curious to learn more about the franchise and its history. Here are some interesting facts about Evil Dead that you may not know:

- **The Evil Dead was based on a short film**: Before making The Evil Dead, Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and Robert Tapert made a 30-minute Super 8 film called Within the Woods, which they used to show potential investors what kind of film they were making. The short film had a similar plot and style to The Evil Dead, but with different actors and a lower budget.
- **Joel Coen got his first break as an assistant editor on The Evil Dead**: Before becoming one half of the acclaimed Coen brothers, Joel Coen worked as an assistant editor on The Evil Dead. He was inspired by Raimi's DIY filmmaking and later collaborated with him on several projects. He also hired Bruce Campbell to play the lead role in a pitch trailer for his first feature film, Blood Simple.
- **The Evil Dead used real live ammunition**: The Evil Dead was notorious for its practical effects and extreme gore, which sometimes involved using real and dangerous materials. For example, in one scene where Ash shoots a possessed woman in the head, Raimi used a real shotgun and live ammunition to create the effect. He also used real animal entrails and cockroaches for the melting corpse scene.
- **Stephen King endorsed The Evil Dead**: The Evil Dead had a hard time finding a distributor in the US, as many studios were put off by its graphic violence and low-budget look. However, it got a boost when horror master Stephen King saw it at the Cannes Film Festival and wrote a glowing review of it, calling it "the most ferociously original horror film of the year." His endorsement helped The Evil Dead get a wider release and recognition.
- **Ash's longevity was not in the original plan**: Bruce Campbell's Ash became one of the most iconic horror heroes of all time, but he was not meant to survive or return for sequels. In fact, Raimi originally planned to kill off Ash at the end of The Evil Dead, but changed his mind at the last minute. He also intended to end Evil Dead 2 with Ash dying in medieval times, but decided to leave it open for a possible sequel. Ash's character also evolved from a timid victim to a wisecracking badass over the course of the franchise.

These are just some of the fascinating facts about Evil Dead that you can discover by watching the movies. Whether you prefer the original horror classic or the modern remake, you will find something to enjoy in this franchise. Just remember to watch it legally and safely, and don't read any ancient books of evil out loud.
