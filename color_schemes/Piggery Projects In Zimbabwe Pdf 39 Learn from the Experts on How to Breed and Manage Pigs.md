Pig farming is one of the most profitable agricultural enterprises in Zimbabwe. According to the Zimbabwe Agricultural Growth Programme (ZAGP), the country has a potential to produce over 100,000 tonnes of pork annually, but currently only produces about 20,000 tonnes. This means there is a huge gap in the market that can be filled by small-scale pig producers.
 
If you are interested in starting a piggery project in Zimbabwe, you will need a good business plan that covers all aspects of pig production, such as breed selection, housing, feeding, health management, marketing and financial analysis. A well-written business plan will help you secure funding from banks, donors or investors, as well as guide you through the implementation of your project.

## Piggery Project Challenges and Opportunities in Zimbabwe
 
Despite the potential of pig farming in Zimbabwe, there are also some challenges that need to be overcome. Some of these include:
 
Progress in Zimbabwe's small-scale pig production,  EU-funded ZAGP initiative for pig industry,  Tarara farm sets African record for piglets/sow/year,  Zimbabwe Agricultural Growth Programme for pig farming,  Challenges and opportunities for pig production in Zimbabwe,  Pig Industry Board of Zimbabwe parastatal,  Practical courses in pig husbandry by PIB,  Installation of biogas digesters for piggery,  Compensation for foreign white farmers in Zimbabwe,  Sow removal in a commercial pig herd in Zimbabwe,  Piggery project addresses basic constraints for smallholders,  Market for pigs and pig products in Kenya,  Piggery industry value chain players and supporters,  Agri-Park concept for South Africa piggery,  Summer infertility in pigs due to rain,  Sow and boar breeds for high litter size,  Split suckling and milk replacers for piglets,  Home-made colostrum for newborn piglets,  Piggery project monitoring and evaluation,  Pork consumption trends in Sub-Sahara Africa,  Piggery project beneficiaries and stakeholders,  Pig production challenges and solutions,  Pig production and productivity enhancement,  Access to viable markets for pig farmers,  Improving breeds and genetics for piggery,  Upscaling subsistence producers to commercial stage,  Pig feed formulation and processing,  Pig health management and disease control,  Pig waste management and environmental impact,  Pig slaughter and meat quality standards,  Pig meat processing and value addition,  Pig marketing policy and regulations,  Pig cooperatives and associations formation,  Pig extension services and information dissemination,  Pig research and innovation development,  Pig financing and credit access,  Pig insurance and risk management,  Pig gender and social inclusion issues,  Pig youth empowerment and employment creation,  Pig advocacy and policy dialogue platforms
 
- Inferior breeds: Most local pigs have low genetic potential and produce fewer piglets than improved breeds. They also have low feed conversion efficiency and carcass quality.
- Unavailability of funding: Many pig farmers lack access to credit facilities to finance their operations. They also face high interest rates and collateral requirements from banks and other lenders.
- High feed and drug costs: Feed constitutes about 70% of the total cost of pig production. The prices of feed ingredients such as maize, soybean, wheat bran and fish meal are often high and fluctuate depending on the season and availability. Similarly, drugs and vaccines are also expensive and sometimes scarce.
- Persistent droughts: Zimbabwe has experienced recurrent droughts in recent years, affecting crop production and water availability. This has reduced the availability of feed resources and water for pigs, as well as increased the risk of diseases and heat stress.
- Lack of management skills: Many pig farmers lack adequate knowledge and skills on how to manage their pigs effectively. They also lack access to extension services and training opportunities to improve their production practices.
- Insufficient extension services: The Pig Industry Board (PIB) is the main provider of extension services to pig farmers in Zimbabwe. However, the PIB has limited staff, resources and coverage, making it difficult to reach all farmers and address their needs.
- Marketing policy bottlenecks: The pig industry in Zimbabwe is regulated by various policies and laws that affect the marketing of pigs and pork products. Some of these include the Livestock Development Levy Act, the Veterinary Services Act, the Meat Marketing Act, the Standards Association of Zimbabwe Act, and the Environmental Management Act. These policies and laws impose various fees, taxes, licenses, permits, standards and regulations that increase the cost of doing business and limit the market access for pig farmers.

However, there are also some opportunities that can be exploited by pig farmers in Zimbabwe to overcome these challenges and improve their profitability. Some of these include:

- EU funding: The European Union (EU) has provided a US$ 40 million facility to support the Zimbabwe Agricultural Growth Programme (ZAGP), which aims to enhance production, productivity, access to viable markets and improve breeds in various livestock sectors, including pigs. The ZAGP is implemented by a consortium of partners led by ActionAid Zimbabwe.
- New breeding stock: Through the ZAGP, pig farmers can access improved breeding stock that have higher genetic potential and performance than local breeds. For example, a farm in Mashonaland East province has set a new African record of 31 piglets born alive per sow per year using a Dalland/Large White crossbreed sow mated to a Large White/Duroc boar.
- Value chain development: The ZAGP also aims to develop value chains for livestock products by linking producers with processors, traders, retailers and consumers. This will help to create more market opportunities for pig farmers and increase their bargaining power and income.
- Compensation for commercial farmers: The government of Zimbabwe has announced that foreign white farmers whose land was seized during the land redistribution programme can apply to get it back or be offered land elsewhere if restitution is impractical. This could create more opportunities for pig farming on commercial farms that have better infrastructure and resources than small-scale farms.
- Youth empowerment: Pig farming is an attractive option for young people who want to venture into agriculture as a source of livelihood. Pig farming requires less land, capital and labour than other livestock enterprises. It also has a short production cycle and high returns on investment. Young people can benefit from various programmes that support youth empowerment through pig farming, such as the Value Chain Alliance for Livestock Upgrading and Empowerment (VALUE) project led by ActionAid Zimbabwe.

In conclusion, pig farming is a viable business in Zimbabwe that can contribute to food security, income generation, employment creation and economic development. However, there are some challenges that need to be addressed to enhance its productivity and profitability. There are also some opportunities that can be exploited by pig farmers to overcome these challenges and improve their competitiveness. Pig farmers need to adopt best practices in breed selection, housing, feeding, health management
