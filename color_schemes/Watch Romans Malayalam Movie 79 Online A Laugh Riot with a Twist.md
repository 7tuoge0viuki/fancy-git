The film revolves around two convicts, Akash (Kunchacko Boban) and Shibu (Biju Menon), who escape from a train while being transported to a jail. They end up in a village called Poomala, which is on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. The villagers mistake them for two priests who are supposed to reopen their old church. The duo decide to play along and take advantage of the situation. However, they soon realize that the villagers have a dark secret that involves a previous priest and a girl who committed suicide.
 
The film is a laugh riot from start to finish, with witty dialogues and hilarious situations. The chemistry between Kunchacko Boban and Biju Menon is excellent, and they deliver their comic timing with perfection. Nivetha Thomas plays the role of Annamma, a girl who falls in love with Akash, and she does a decent job. The supporting cast, including T G Ravi, Vijayaraghavan, Kochu Preman and Kalabhavan Shaju, also add to the humor quotient of the film.
 
The film also has some thrilling moments, especially in the climax, where the truth about the villagers and their past is revealed.
