However, RYTOOLS.rar is not an official product of WinRAR or its developers. It is a custom-made archive that was uploaded to Google Drive[^3^] by an unknown user. Therefore, it may contain malware or viruses that could harm your computer or data. Use it at your own risk and discretion.
 
If you still want to use RYTOOLS.rar, you will need to download it from Google Drive[^3^] and extract it using WinRAR or another compatible program. Then, you can run the tools inside the archive, such as RAR.exe, UNRAR.exe, ZIP.exe, etc. These tools allow you to compress and extract files using various options and parameters. For example, you can use RAR.exe to create a new RAR archive with the command:
 `rar a -m5 -r -s -df -ep1 newarchive.rar files\*` 
This command will create a new archive named newarchive.rar with the best compression level (-m5), recursive subdirectories (-r), solid archive (-s), delete files after archiving (-df) and exclude base directory name (-ep1) from the files in the files folder.
 
You can also use UNRAR.exe to extract files from an existing RAR archive with the command:
 `unrar x -y -o+ oldarchive.rar` 
This command will extract all files from oldarchive.rar with overwrite mode (-y), overwrite existing files (-o+) and preserve original attributes and timestamps.
 
For more information on how to use these tools, you can refer to the help files included in the archive or visit the official WinRAR website[^1^]. Remember to scan the archive and the tools with an antivirus program before using them.

Another tool that you can use from RYTOOLS.rar is ZIP.exe, which allows you to create and extract ZIP files. ZIP files are another common format for compressed files that can be opened by Windows 10[^1^] and other programs. ZIP files can also store multiple files and folders in one archive.
 
To create a ZIP file using ZIP.exe, you can use the following command:
 `zip -r -9 newzip.zip files\*` 
This command will create a new ZIP file named newzip.zip with the maximum compression level (-9) and recursive subdirectories (-r) from the files in the files folder.
 
To extract a ZIP file using ZIP.exe, you can use the following command:
 `zip -e oldzip.zip` 
This command will extract all files from oldzip.zip to the current directory.
 
For more information on how to use ZIP.exe, you can refer to the help file included in the archive or visit the How-To Geek website[^2^]. Remember to scan the archive and the tools with an antivirus program before using them.
