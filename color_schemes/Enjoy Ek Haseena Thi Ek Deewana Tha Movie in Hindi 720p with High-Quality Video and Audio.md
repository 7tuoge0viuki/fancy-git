## Movie Review: Ek Haseena Thi Ek Deewana Tha
 
Ek Haseena Thi Ek Deewana Tha is a movie that tries to revive the old-fashioned formula of romance, mystery and reincarnation. However, the movie fails to impress with its weak script, poor direction and mediocre performances. The movie is a disappointment for the fans of Suneel Darshan, who has given some hit movies in the past like Dhadkan, Andaaz and Barsaat.
 
The movie suffers from a lack of logic, coherence and originality. The plot is full of cliches, loopholes and absurdities. The movie borrows heavily from other movies like Karz, Om Shanti Om and Raaz Reboot, but does not do justice to any of them. The movie also has some unintentionally funny scenes and dialogues that make you laugh for the wrong reasons.
 
The movie does not have any redeeming qualities in terms of acting or music. The lead actors Shiv Darshan, Natasha Fernandez and Upen Patel are wooden and expressionless. They do not have any chemistry or charisma on screen. The supporting cast is also wasted and irrelevant. The music by Nadeem is average and forgettable. The songs are poorly picturized and do not add any value to the movie.
 
Ek Haseena Thi Ek Deewana Tha is a movie that should be avoided at all costs. It is a waste of time and money. It is a movie that will make you regret watching it.
