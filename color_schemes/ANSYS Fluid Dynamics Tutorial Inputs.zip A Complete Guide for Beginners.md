Once you log in to the Ansys Customer Portal, go to Knowledge Resources > Tutorials & Training Materials. There you will find a list of tutorials for various Ansys products. Select Ansys Fluent and scroll down to find the ANSYS\_Fluid\_Dynamics\_Tutorial\_Inputs.zip file. Click on the download icon to save the file to your computer.
 
## Step 2: Extract the file
 
The ANSYS\_Fluid\_Dynamics\_Tutorial\_Inputs.zip file is a compressed folder that contains several subfolders and files. To use them, you need to extract them to a location of your choice. You can use any software that can handle zip files, such as WinZip, WinRAR, or 7-Zip. Right-click on the zip file and choose Extract All or Extract Here. You will see a folder named ANSYS\_Fluid\_Dynamics\_Tutorial\_Inputs with several subfolders inside.
 
## Step 3: Use the file
 
To use the tutorial input files, you need to have Ansys Fluent installed on your computer. You can launch Ansys Fluent from the Ansys Workbench or as a standalone application. To open an input file, go to File > Open and browse to the location where you extracted the zip file. Select the subfolder that corresponds to the tutorial you want to follow and open the .cas or .dat file. This will load the geometry, mesh, boundary conditions, and solver settings for the tutorial.
 
To run the simulation, go to Solve > Initialize > Initialize and then Solve > Run Calculation. You can monitor the convergence of the solution by checking the residuals and other quantities of interest. To visualize the results, go to Display > Contours or Display > Vectors and choose the variables you want to plot. You can also create animations, streamlines, iso-surfaces, and other postprocessing features.
 
To learn more about each tutorial, you can refer to the documentation that comes with Ansys Fluent or visit the Ansys Learning Forum[^4^] where you can find videos, discussions, and answers to common questions. You can also find other online resources such as YouTube videos[^1^] [^2^] or ResearchGate posts[^1^] [^2^] that explain how to use these tutorials.
