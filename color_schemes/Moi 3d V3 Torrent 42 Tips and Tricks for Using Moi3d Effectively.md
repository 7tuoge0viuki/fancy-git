NURBS stands for Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines, which are mathematical curves and surfaces that can represent any shape with a high degree of accuracy. NURBS are widely used in computer graphics, engineering, and manufacturing. Moi 3d V3 uses NURBS as the basis for its modeling tools, which allow you to draw and edit curves and surfaces with intuitive gestures and commands.
 
Some of the NURBS drawing tools in Moi 3d V3 include:
 
- Point: Draws a single point.
- Line: Draws a straight line segment.
- Polyline: Draws a series of connected line segments.
- Freeform: Draws a freehand curve.
- Arc: Draws a circular arc.
- Ellipse: Draws an ellipse or a circle.
- Rectangle: Draws a rectangle or a square.
- Polygon: Draws a regular polygon with a specified number of sides.
- Star: Draws a star with a specified number of points.
- Spiral: Draws a spiral curve.
- Helix: Draws a helical curve.

You can also use various commands to modify the curves and surfaces, such as:

- Trim: Cuts away parts of the curves or surfaces that are outside or inside a cutting object.
- Fillet: Rounds off sharp corners or edges of the curves or surfaces.
- Chamfer: Bevels off sharp corners or edges of the curves or surfaces.
- Blend: Creates a smooth transition between two curves or surfaces.
- Sweep: Creates a surface by sweeping one or more curves along a path curve.
