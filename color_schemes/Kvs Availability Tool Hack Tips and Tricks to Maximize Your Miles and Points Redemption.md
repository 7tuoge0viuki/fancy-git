- Use the free trial version. The KVS Availability Tool offers a 10-day free trial for new users. You can download the latest version from [http://www.kvstool.com/](http://www.kvstool.com/) and use it for 10 days without any limitations. This is a great way to test the tool and see if it meets your needs. You can also create multiple accounts with different email addresses and use the free trial multiple times.
- Use alternative methods. The KVS Availability Tool uses various methods to access flight information from different sources, such as airline websites, online travel agencies, global distribution systems and more. Some of these methods are more reliable and accurate than others, but they may also require higher membership levels or additional fees. You can try using alternative methods that are cheaper or free, such as [Awards/BA-OneWorld], [Awards/QF-OneWorld], [Awards/JL-OneWorld], [Awards/NH-StarAlliance], [Awards/DL-SkyTeam] and [Awards/CX-OneWorld]. These methods use the websites of partner airlines to search for award availability on OneWorld, Star Alliance and SkyTeam alliances. You can find more information about these methods in the [KVS Tool User Guide](http://Help.KVSTool.com/).
- Use web scraping tools. Web scraping is a technique that involves extracting data from websites using automated scripts or programs. You can use web scraping tools to access flight information from websites that the KVS Availability Tool does not support or charges extra fees for. For example, you can use web scraping tools to access flight information from [http://data.flight24.com/flights/](http://data.flight24.com/flights/), which provides real-time flight tracking and historical flight data. However, web scraping may violate the terms of use of some websites, so you should exercise caution and discretion when using this technique.
