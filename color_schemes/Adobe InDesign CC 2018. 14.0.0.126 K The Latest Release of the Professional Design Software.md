## Layout Adjustment
 
One of the most useful features in Adobe InDesign CC 2018 is the Layout Adjustment feature. This feature allows you to automatically adjust all elements in your layout when you change the page size, page margin, or bleed of your document. You no longer need to manually resize or reposition your text, images, or other objects when you make changes to your document settings. The Layout Adjustment feature can save you a lot of time and hassle when working with different page formats or layouts.
 
## Import PDF Comments
 
Another great feature in Adobe InDesign CC 2018 is the ability to import any marked up PDF into InDesign and easily track the feedback and comments noted in the PDF. You can accept comments and mark them resolved or unresolved. Selecting a comment also highlights the section in the document where the comment is applicable. This feature can help you collaborate more effectively with your clients or colleagues and streamline your review process.
 
## Properties Panel
 
The new Properties panel in Adobe InDesign CC 2018 lets you view settings and controls in the context of your current task or workflow. This new panel has been designed with ease of use in mind, ensuring that you have access to the right controls when you need them. The Properties panel is available by default in the Essentials workspace. You can also enable it from Window > Properties.
 
## Visual Font Browsing
 
You can now browse thousands of fonts from hundreds of type foundries from within InDesign, activate them instantly, and use them in your documents. The Fonts panel includes various new options to provide you an enriched experience while working with fonts. You can apply a filter to view only the recently added fonts. You can also select a sample text from the list of predefined text for font preview or select your own text as well. You now also have the option to change the font size while previewing the font.
 
## OpenType SVG Fonts Support
 
With the support for OpenType SVG fonts in InDesign, you can now provide multiple colors and gradients in a single glyph. Using OpenType SVG emoji fonts, you can include various colorful and graphical characters, such as smileys, flags, street signs, animals, people, food, and landmarks in your documents. You can also create composite glyphs. For example, using the EmojiOne font, you can create the flags of countries or achieve skin tone diversity in your glyphs.
